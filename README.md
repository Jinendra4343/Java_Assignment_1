# Java Assignment

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a basic Java application that demonstrates core programming techniques: collecting user input, validating that input, and processing it via modular methods. The program is simple, beginner-friendly, and demonstrates standard Java practices: use of classes, input handling, validation, and error management.

## 2. Problem Statement

User input is unpredictable and can lead to bugs or unreliable results. This project solves that problem by introducing Java tools for prompting, validating, and processing user data. It helps users learn to create clean, maintainable programs while understanding procedural logic and handling errors gracefully.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java 17+
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `java.util.Scanner`
  - Standard Java libraries (no external dependencies)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VSCode / Eclipse / Any Java-supported IDE

## 4. Implementation Steps

- Prompt user to enter data via the console.
- Validate the input (type/format/range) using conditionals.
- If valid, process the data with Java methods and display the result.
- Handle invalid input and exceptions gracefully using try/catch.
