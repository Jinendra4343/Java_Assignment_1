# Java_Assignment_1

1. Project Overview
This project is a basic Java application that demonstrates introductory programming concepts by solving common problems. For example, it might prompt the user for input, validate the data, and process it to produce meaningful output. The code is beginner-friendly and showcases the use of Java classes, methods, input handling, validation, and basic error management.

2. Problem Statement
In many real-world situations, collecting and verifying user data is crucialâ€”poor input can lead to errors and unreliable results. This assignment provides simple Java tools for user input, validation, and procedural logic. By tackling practical problems (such as filtering data, performing basic calculations, or managing small records), the project teaches effective ways to build robust, modular, and maintainable Java code.

3. Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java 17+

Libraries Used: Standard Java libraries (no external dependencies required)

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code (with Java extensions), Eclipse, or any Java-supported IDE

4. Implementation Steps
Prompt the user for input via the console (Scanner or BufferedReader).

Validate input (check for correct type, range, or format).

Process the data using appropriate logic in Java methods.

Handle errors and exceptions gracefully (try/catch blocks, user-friendly messages).
